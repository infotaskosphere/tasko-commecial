"""
ROC Sphere — Companies Act (India) compliance & document automation module.

Self-contained backend router. Nothing here is imported by any other
existing module, so dropping this file into backend/ does not touch any
existing behaviour. It is wired into the app with exactly two lines in
server.py (see INTEGRATION.md):

    from backend.roc_sphere import router as roc_sphere_router
    api_router.include_router(roc_sphere_router)

Covers:
  - Company master (linked to an existing Client, or standalone)
  - Directors / shareholders register
  - Upload & best-effort parse of AOC-4 / MGT-7 / MGT-7A / ADT-1 / DPT-3
    PDFs plus the separate macro-enabled MGT-7A shareholder workbook
  - Share-transfer register, SH-4 instrument and share-certificate drafts
  - Companies Act 2013 compliance checklist engine (heuristic, based on
    company category/size — see COMPLIANCE_RULES below)
  - Word (.docx) generation for: Board Resolution, Notice of Meeting
    (Board/EGM/AGM), Minutes of Meeting (Board/General), Register of
    Members / List of Shareholders, and a printable Compliance Checklist

IMPORTANT — legal disclaimer baked into the product, not just this
comment: MCA thresholds and formats change (e.g. the "small company"
paid-up capital/turnover limits were revised effective 1 Dec 2025). The
checklist engine is a drafting aid, not a substitute for a professional's
judgement, and COMPLIANCE_RULES should be reviewed periodically against
the current Companies Act / MCA rules.

#                            AGM date, board meeting date)
#                             — read from whichever recognised ROC form
#                               states them (present on most of AOC-4,
#                               AOC-2, MGT-7/7A, Board's/Auditor's Report)

# from a form that isn't its statutory source, so one wrong/unusual PDF in
# a batch can no longer pollute Directors & Shareholders (this replaced an
# earlier version that scanned the full text of every uploaded form for
# anything DIN/PAN-shaped, which produced garbage director rows out of
# AOC-4/AOC-2/Board & Auditor report boilerplate — see CHANGELOG below).
#
# This is a heuristic text-scrape (same approach as backend/compliance.py's
# parse_compliance_dates), not an XBRL parser — every applied field is
# still shown to the user in the "Extracted fields" preview and can be
# corrected on the Company Master / Directors & Shareholders tabs.
