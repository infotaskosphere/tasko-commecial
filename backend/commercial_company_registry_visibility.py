"""Keep license-generated companies out of the Platform Owner Company Master.

License generation creates a commercial customer record plus an internal
operational company record so tenant relationships remain intact. That record
must remain visible to the License Registry and to its own licensee, but it
must not appear in the Platform Owner's normal operational Company Master.

Context rules
  * Platform Owner (operational modules)  -> licensee companies are hidden.
  * Platform Owner Commercial Console     -> unfiltered (intentional access).
  * Licensee admin / user                 -> never touched by this filter, so
                                             their own licensed company stays
                                             visible.
