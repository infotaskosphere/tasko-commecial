"""
MODULE 1 — Zero-Touch Entry Engine (Invoice → Journal)
=======================================================
Pipeline:
  1. TRIGGER   : `POST /api/zte/upload` (manual upload) — swap in a storage-bucket
                 event listener (S3/GCS "on_receipt_upload") or an inbox poller
                 ("on_invoice_email_received") to call `process_document(...)`
                 automatically; the extraction logic below is already decoupled
                 from the HTTP trigger so either wiring is a thin shim.
  2. EXTRACT   : Vision LLM (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via
                 backend/services/gemini_client.py) called in JSON-schema /
                 forced-JSON mode —
                 no static template, works off any invoice layout. Also extracts
                 the invoice currency and who the document is billed to, so the
                 pipeline can convert foreign-currency invoices to INR and figure
                 out which of the firm's companies the invoice belongs to.
  3. RESOLVE   : `resolve_company()` matches the extracted "billed to" details
                 against Company Profiles (`db.companies`) for multi-company
                 setups. Two tiers:
                   a) Deterministic — GSTIN → billing email → company name,
                      in that priority order (cheap, exact, no LLM call).
                   b) AI fallback — if none of those match and more than one
                      company is configured, `_ai_resolve_company()` sends the
                      extracted document context + the candidate company list
                      to the LLM and asks it to pick the best match with a
                      confidence score. Only accepted above a confidence
                      threshold; otherwise the document is held for manual
                      company assignment rather than guessed.
  4. CONVERT   : if the extracted currency isn't INR, `get_historical_fx_rate()`
                 fetches the ECB reference rate for that invoice's date (via the
                 free Frankfurter API, cached) and every amount is converted to
                 INR before anything is posted — so a $8.02 receipt is booked at
                 that day's actual rate, not booked as "₹8.02".
  5. PREVIEW   : `classify_expense_account()` inspects the vendor name and the
                 firm's own learned category rules to pick a ledger account,
                 then `build_ledger_preview()` assembles the balanced
                 double-entry lines — but does NOT post them. The computed
                 preview is stored on the document with status
                 `"pending_approval"`.
  6. APPROVE   : Nothing reaches the ledger without a human clicking
                 Approve. `POST /documents/{id}/approve` takes the stored
                 preview and posts it via `accounting_core.post_journal_entry`
                 (reused, not re-implemented, so trial balance / P&L / balance
                 sheet reports stay consistent). `POST /documents/{id}/reject`
                 discards the preview instead, with a mandatory reason.
  7. AUDIT     : Every approved entry is flagged `source="ai_zero_touch"` and is
                 immutable once posted (see accounting_lock.py, Module 4) —
                 corrections must go through an Adjustment Note Override rather
                 than editing the original voucher.

The AI extracts, matches companies, converts currency, and drafts the entry
end-to-end with zero manual data entry — but nothing is committed to the
books until a human with posting rights reviews and approves it.

Nothing here talks to a real object-storage bucket or mail server; those
triggers are infra-specific to how Taskosphere is deployed. Wire the bucket/
email webhook to call `process_document(file_bytes, filename, ...)` below.
