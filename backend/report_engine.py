Trademark availability report engine — v2.

Pure rule-based analysis (no external LLM). Takes raw scraped results and
produces a structured availability verdict with:
  - overall_status: AVAILABLE / CAUTION / CONFLICT
  - risk_score (0-100)
  - exact_matches, phonetic_matches, contains_matches
  - class_breakdown (all scraped classes, not just the filtered one)
  - recommendations
  - alternative_name_suggestions

Key improvement over v1:
  - build_report now accepts class_filter for display purposes but always
    analyses ALL scraped results. The class_breakdown shows all classes found,
    while the match analysis focuses on the filtered class if specified.
  - all_results in the response always includes ALL classes so the frontend
    can switch class views without re-fetching.
